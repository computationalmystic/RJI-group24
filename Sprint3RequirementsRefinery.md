How a user will interact with our system: 

The user for the RJI project will likely be an editor, photographer, or designer; in other words, someone who works for a journalistic company and needs access to photos. 
They will specifically need an organizational system that will tell them the image quality of their photos and enable them to access photos of a certain rating.
First, the user (possibly a photographer, or someone who photos needed to be uploaded), will select files from their machine to upload to the database.
Using the tabs at the top of the webpage, they will then be able to select “View,” use a sliding scale to indicate the photo rating they prefer (from 1-10), and search photos that fall within that range.
The photographer may want to use this feature to grade the photos, or this may be an editor or designer, someone who is looking for a photo to fit their story or layout. 
The user will then be able to download individual photos. Lastly, the “Delete” tab gives them the ability to delete photos from the database. 



List of issues and how we will resolve them: 

1. One issue that we are having is that we are having problems getting the photo grader to work on our aws server. We will resolve this issue by going to office hours to get some help on how to get our photo grader to work. Specifically, how to create a shell script and ensure the right version of Python is being called through the idelo image-quality-assessment. 
2. Another issue that we have is that we need to add a login. We will resolve this issue by adding a login in the near future.
3. Another issue that we have is that we need to add a download button for the pictures. We will resolve this issue looking up more information about downloading picture and plan to add the download button in the near future. 
4. Another issue that we are having is that the photos can take a while to upload if they are either too big or the program is being run on bad internet. We are not really sure how to resolve this problem but we will ask other groups if they are running into the same issue.

Place a short 1-2 paragraph statement in your repository root, called "our-classifier.md" that explains:

What image classifier technology you used for your projects

Whether or not you have started to build classifiers off of the pictures from Ed McCain or if you are still using the default example classifiers. 
Explain the advantages and limitations of your choice.



The image classifier technology that we used for our project is the idealo image-quality-assessment. Right now we are still using the default example classifiers because we are having issues with the photo grader to work on our server.

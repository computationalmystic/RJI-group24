Place a short 1-2 paragraph statement in your repository root, called "our-classifier.md" that explains:

What image classifier technology you used for your projects

Whether or not you have started to build classifiers off of the pictures from Ed McCain or if you are still using the default example classifiers. 
Explain the advantages and limitations of your choice.



The image classifier technology that we used for our project is the idealo image-quality-assessment. We have not yet used the pictures from Ed McCain, but have been uploading random photos of our own to test. So, we're a little further ahead than using the default example classifiers. The advantage of using photos from our personal machines that are easily accessible to us ensures that we can quickly test small changes made in the code. The pictures from Ed McCain take some time to access and upload, as they are most likely larger files. Right now we need the ability to easily test our code because we have not yet gotten our image classifier to work as it is being called from our .php file. We've been troubleshooting this, and as soon as we can ensure it's working and grading the photos, we will switch over to uploading and using Ed McCain's photos.
